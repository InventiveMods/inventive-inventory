**⚙️ -> Configurable Option**

## Features 🚀💡
### Sorting 🔀🔠
There's a mess in your inventory? No problem, a simple key press (Default: R)⚙️ will it get organized.

The sorting function is aware of the cursor’s position.  
This means that if you’re in a container and hover over your inventory, the inventory will be sorted instead of the container.  
In all other scenarios, the container will be sorted.

By pressing the Advanced Operation Key you can keep your cursor stack while sorting. ⚙️
> This feature is compatible with all types of containers.

### Locked Slots 🔒🚫
You can lock slots in your inventory by holding the Advanced Operation Key (Default: Alt) and clicking on the slot.  
Items in such a slot will not be affected by sorting, automatic refilling or profile loading. ⚙️ (for every feature seperatley)

Additionally, picked-up items or quick-moved won't be placed in such a slot either and will rather get dropped. ⚙️

### Profiles 📋📂
Save your current hotbar and offhand state and load it anytime back.

### Automatic Refilling 🔄📦

Useful for building with many materials or just to always have some food ready.  
Works with buckets, bowls and bottles as well as tools.  
You can press the Advanced Operation Key (Default: ALT)⚙️ to prevent the stack from refilling.⚙️  

### Item Counter 🔢📊
Keep track of your resources at a glance!  
The Item Counter sums up all identical items in your inventory and displays the total amount (unit is items or stacks depending on config ⚙️) directly in the hotbar.  
Perfect for builders and miners who want to know exactly how much they have left without constantly opening their inventory.
